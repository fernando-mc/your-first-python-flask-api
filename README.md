# Your First Python Flask API

Note - This is a condensed version of a tutorial appearing on [my blog](https://www.fernandomc.com)

## First, get some data:

For the purposes of this tutorial, you can download your own dataset [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND) or you can use the data.csv file in this repository to follow along with the rest of it.

## Then prepare your environment
1. Install Python 3
2. Create a virtual environment
3. install dependencies

## Write your API!
